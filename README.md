# DataContest backend

[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/servomac/datacontest-api.svg?style=shield&circle-token=:circle-token)](https://circleci.com/gh/servomac/datacontest-api)

DataContest is a free software web app designed to host machine learning competitions.

This repo contains the backend code of the application. It exposes an API to create and host datathons, with user authentication. It is designed with a kind of [clean architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) in mind.

**Project status**: This is just a draft, a work in progress. It's clearly over-architected, and not really well designed. Its mainly a sideproject to experiment and learn, but my idea is to build a MVP and release it *into the wild*. Any contribution or comment will be welcomed (say me what i'm doing wrong, please! :D).
